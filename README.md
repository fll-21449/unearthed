# Rocket Fish programs for Unearthed season

We're trying Python this season. This repo tracks our code changes throughout the season.

## Synopsis

1. Install mind-meld.

   ```
   go install github.com/spraints/mind-meld@latest
   ```

1. Sync from the LEGO app to this repo (locally and to GitHub).

    ```
    ./sync.sh
    ```
    
1. View the programs on the
   [programs](https://github.com/fll-21449/unearthed/tree/programs) branch.

Optionally, run `./diff.sh` to see what has changed since the last sync.
